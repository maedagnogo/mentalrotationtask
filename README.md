# mentalrotationtask

These are scripts I wrote to create a 2D mental rotation task with expyriment.

"shapesgenerationv1.py" is the script to execute in order to generate the 12 png files that will be used as stimuli during the experiment.
"mentalrotation.py" is the file that will execute the expyriment.
